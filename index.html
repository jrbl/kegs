  <h2>Hey, what is this?</h2>

  <p>"Bottles and Kegs" is a drinking game, where participants sit in a circle and
  count out loud.  The first person says any number, the next says the next 
  number, and so forth.  When somebody says the wrong thing, they take a drink.</p>

  <p>Sounds like a pretty boring drinking game, doesn't it?</p>

  <p>The problem is that when the number is divisible by five, you're not supposed
to say your number, but instead say "bottles".  And when it's divisible by 
seven, you're to say, "kegs".  And if it's divisible by five and by seven, then
you say "bottles and kegs".  Just those words in that order.  And the next
person, the one next to you who just heard you say "kegs"?  They have to start
the count at the correct number.  Which is whatever number you would have said,
but didn't, plus one.</p>

  <p>Now is it starting to sound more interesting?</p>

  <p>The problem is, your friends <b>always</b> want to play Bottles and Kegs, and you
  always lose.  This was fun at first, but <i>midterms are coming</i> and you need to
win a little or you're going to flunk out.  Don't worry; we've got you covered.</p>

  <p>Here is a handy-dandy app which will help you win.  Just load this baby up on
your phone and when it's your turn, put in the number you're on and hit the
button.  Just say what we tell you and you'll (probably) make it to morning.</p>

  <p>Or, if nobody's cheating and everyone's already smashed, you can use this
app to check whether it's time for the speaker to drink more.</p>
